# ExampleContract README

## Overview

This is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. The contract is named `ExampleContract` and features a basic ownership mechanism, allowing only the contract owner to modify a public variable named `value`. The contract also includes additional conditions for updating the value, demonstrating the use of modifiers and various require/assert statements.

## Contract Details

### State Variables

- `owner`: Public address variable representing the owner of the contract.
- `value`: Public uint256 variable that can be modified by the owner.

### Constructor

- The constructor sets the contract deployer's address as the initial owner.

### Modifier

- `onlyOwner`: A modifier ensuring that only the owner can call specific functions.

### Function

- `setValue(uint256 _newValue) external onlyOwner`: This function allows the owner to set a new value for the `value` variable, subject to certain conditions.
  - Requires the caller to be the owner.
  - Requires the new value to be greater than zero.
  - Ensures the new value does not exceed the maximum value for a uint256.
  - Reverts if the new value is 42.
