# Smart Contract README - ExampleContract

## Overview

This Ethereum smart contract, named `ExampleContract`, is a simple demonstration of ownership and variable modification using Solidity. The contract allows the owner to set a value, enforcing certain conditions to ensure proper behavior.

## Contract Details

### State Variables

- `owner`: A public address variable representing the owner of the contract.
- `value`: A public uint256 variable that can be modified by the owner.

### Constructor

- The constructor sets the contract deployer's address as the initial owner.

### Modifier

- `onlyOwner`: A modifier ensuring that only the owner can call specific functions.

### Function

#### `setValue(uint256 _newValue) external onlyOwner`

This function allows the owner to set a new value for the `value` variable, subject to the following conditions:

1. Requires the new value to be greater than zero.
2. Asserts that the new value does not exceed the maximum value for a uint256.
3. Reverts if the new value is 42, preventing the value from being set to this specific number.
4. Sets the `value` variable to the new value.

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network using a compatible Solidity compiler.

2. **Interact with the Contract:**
   - Interact with the contract using an Ethereum wallet or a smart contract interaction tool.

3. **Set a New Value:**
   - Call the `setValue` function, providing a new value as an argument.
   - Ensure that the provided value meets the specified conditions to successfully update the `value` variable.
